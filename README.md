### Code to Device

To prepare device for installation, flash the code here written for the TTGO T1 display to a ESP32 by running it on the Arduino IDE and connecting the device to a computer using a USB-C cable.

### Suspension Setup:

Tie a string around a popsicle stick with a hole punched in it for suspending the device from an elevated place. Cut a hole the size of the TTGO T1 display in a small envelope and punch holes in the sides for string to be threaded through. Customize the envelope as desired.

### Power Connection

Solder and crimp an attachment connector in order to link a battery to the device. Insulate the crimping by adding heat shrink to the connector, ensuring a safe connection to the battery.

Power the device by connecting it to a battery (here we used a 130mAh battery, anticipating a runtime of under 2 hours with the display at full power).

### Activation:

Plug in the adapter to the ESP32 to successfully power it on.
