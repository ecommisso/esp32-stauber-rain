### Code to Device

To prepare device for installation, flash the code here written for the TTGO T1 display to a ESP32 by running it on the Arduino IDE and connecting the device to a computer using a USB-C cable.

### Suspension Setup:

Tie a string around a popsicle stick with a hole punched in it for suspending the device from an elevated place. Cut a hole the size of the TTGO T1 display in a small envelope and punch holes in the sides for string to be threaded through. Customize the envelope as desired.

### Power Connection

Solder and crimp an attachment connector in order to link a battery to the device. Insulate the crimping by adding heat shrink to the connector, ensuring a safe connection to the battery.

Power the device by connecting it to a battery (here we used a 130mAh battery, anticipating a runtime of under 2 hours with the display at full power).

### Activation:

Plug in the adapter to the ESP32 to successfully power it on.

### Display

Place both the powered-on ESP32 and the connected battery into the envelope and secure the device with tape, to ensure the TTGO display is positioned as desired within the window in the envelope. Suspend the device and watch the animation.
